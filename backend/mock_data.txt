Background and Conflict:
Current Situation: ¥800 billion deficit over five years. Financial pressures.
Logic for Continuing: Core of "economic sphere" (customer LTV is 1.5x).
Logic for Withdrawal: Financial deterioration has reached its limit. Possibility of "sunk cost bias."
Objective of the Meeting: Eliminate sunk cost bias and, based on internal documents (assuming reports from the CFO, CMO, and CTO),
draw a logical, MECE-based conclusion from the following three options that will "maximize corporate value."
Continue Investment
Strategic Shift (Become an MVNO)
Withdraw/Sell
